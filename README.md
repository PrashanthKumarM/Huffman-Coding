# Static and Dynamic Huffman Coding

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the differences between Static and Adaptive Huffman coding. We have built a robust and fast static huffman coding system which performs much better than any adaptive encoding stradegies in C++. We intend to test with different inputs of varying formats and sizes to compare the compression size and time taken to compress and decompress. We also intend to explore the different applications and possibilities to use either of the techniques. In the end we intend to perform a complexity analysis in terms of time and space and prove that the fast static version performs much better than the adaptive approaches.
